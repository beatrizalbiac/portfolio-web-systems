# Portfolio - Web Systems
**By Beatriz Albiac**

### Overview:
This is a project of a portfolio codded only using **HTML** and **CSS**. The prompt was to base the web on a figma desing trying to get it to be as close as posible but while coding everything.
However, it also can be used as a functional portfolio, as it has every section that could be relevant for an employer.

#### The main requirements were the following:
- Translate a Figma design into a static website using HTML and CSS.
- Apply responsive design principles.
- Organize and document a small front-end codebase with clear structure and naming.
- Deploy a static website.

#### Dimensions:
- desktop >= 1024px
